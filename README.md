# **Modeling the Dynamics of Fluctuations in the Brain: Differences Between Resting-State and Cognitive Tasks**  
Reproducibility code


## **Overview**  
The repository provides a complete pipeline to replicate the results presented in the paper.    

The Jupyter Notebooks are numbered and must be executed **sequentially** to ensure correct workflow.


## **Setup Instructions**  

### **1. Clone the Repository**  
```bash
git clone https://github.com/FacuRoffet99/paper-hcp-tasks-hopf-bifurcation.git
```

### **2. Run Notebook 0 (Setup)**  
The first notebook, `0_Setup.ipynb`, will:  
- Install all required libraries and dependencies.  
- Download data from Zenodo.   


## **System Requirements**  

- **Python**: 3.8+  
- **Hardware**:  
   - GPU access is required for model training and recommended for model inference.  
   - At least 16GB of RAM is recommended.

## **Data**  

The dataset required for this project is hosted on Zenodo and will be automatically downloaded by `0_Setup.ipynb`.  

If you wish to download the dataset manually, please refer to the Zenodo link:  
[**[Zenodo Dataset Link](https://zenodo.org/records/14508470)**]  

## **Results**  

- All generated files will be saved in a folder called `results/`.  
- All key findings and visualizations are reproducible using the provided notebooks.
